# FlashFood

# Original Prompt:

- I am a .NET developer and I want to learn new technologies.
- SQL + Entity Framework Core
- NoSQL Mongo db
- Redis cache
- Rabbit MQ
- Microservices and rest api

First pretend you are a business man and create an idea of aplucation, that will utilize all these technologies. Pretend you are non technical.

Then pretend you are a .net software developer or architect, who makes and describes the development plan and explains to me on what parts should be the tech used.

The actual implementation will be upon me.

# Response

Alright, let's go. First, from a businessman’s perspective (non-technical), here's the idea for an application:

Business Idea: FlashFood – Real-Time Food Discount App
People waste too much food. Restaurants and supermarkets throw away perfectly edible meals just because they weren’t sold by end-of-day. FlashFood connects users with local businesses offering time-sensitive food deals.

Key Features:
Users see live discounted meals near them, expiring soon.

Businesses post deals (e.g. “Pizza combo, 70% off – pickup by 8PM”).

Users reserve and pay in-app, then pick up.

Businesses get visibility, reduce waste, and gain revenue from unsold inventory.

Users get cheap, ready-to-eat food.

Now switching roles: I’m a .NET architect, and here’s how I would break this down using your target stack:

Tech Stack Integration Plan
1. SQL + Entity Framework Core
Used for: Core transactional data

Users, restaurants, orders, payments

Relationships matter, transactions matter

EF Core for ease of data modeling and migrations

Why?
Relational consistency is critical—user owns orders, orders are tied to restaurants, payments are tied to orders.

2. MongoDB (NoSQL)
Used for: Offers catalog and historical analytics

Flash offers = unstructured data (custom pricing, images, time-to-live)

Businesses can have dynamic offer templates (flexible schema)

Old offers can be archived for analytics, no need for normalization

Why?
Schema flexibility for fast-changing, business-driven content. Also avoids joins when querying listings.

3. Redis
Used for: Caching hot data

Live offers near the user (geo queries)

Top-rated restaurants, most popular meals

Auth token/session cache

Why?
Speed. This is stuff we want to load in milliseconds. Redis is built for it. TTL on flash offers makes them a perfect fit for expiring cache entries.

4. RabbitMQ
Used for: Asynchronous workflows

After order placed: trigger invoice generation, send notification to restaurant, maybe update analytics DB

After offer created: push to users in geo range

Why?
You don’t want to block order API until all side effects are done. RabbitMQ handles background jobs and decouples services.

5. Microservices + REST APIs
Used for: Service separation and scalability

User Service

Order Service

Offer Service

Restaurant Service

Notification Service

Why?
Clear boundaries, easier to scale pieces independently. Also aligns with modern DevOps practices (containers, CI/CD).

Each microservice exposes REST APIs, secured via token auth (e.g. JWT).

Example Flow (Tech Used)
"User reserves a meal":
Frontend calls Offer API to get live deals near them → Redis (cache) hit

User reserves meal → hits Order API, data written to SQL via EF Core

Order triggers RabbitMQ event → Notify restaurant, store in MongoDB as “archived offer”, etc.

Analytics Service listens and stores stats for future dashboards

Your Development Focus
You’ll need to:

Model core entities in EF Core with proper relationships

Design flexible MongoDB document structures

Use StackExchange.Redis client for caching

Integrate RabbitMQ via MassTransit or native client

Split services cleanly with RESTful APIs

Secure communication (JWT + maybe API Gateway)

Let me know if you want a sample project folder structure or service-by-service breakdown. I can also mock one service end-to-end to get you rolling.
